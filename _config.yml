          During my time at Cornell I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a hard work and perseverance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Social Business and Consulting Club* taking on roles such as *Consultant* and *Executive Director*.
